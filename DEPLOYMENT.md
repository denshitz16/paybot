### 2.2 Frontend Environment Variables

The frontend is served directly by the backend as a static SPA, so no separate frontend deployment is needed. All requests to `/api/...` are handled by the backend, and the React app is served from the same URL.

---

## 3. GitHub Actions Secrets Setup

The GitHub Actions deployment workflow (`deploy.yml`) deploys to Railway automatically on every push to `main`. It requires a Railway project token configured as a GitHub secret.

### 3.1 Generate a Railway Project Token

A **project token** is a scoped token that grants access only to a specific Railway project and environment. This is the recommended token type for CI/CD.

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Open your project
3. Go to **Project Settings** → **Tokens**
4. Click **"New Token"**
5. Give it a name (e.g., `github-actions`) and select the **production** environment
6. Copy the generated token

### 3.2 Add the Secrets as GitHub Secrets

The workflow uses the `production` environment in GitHub Actions. You can add secrets either at the repository level or the environment level:

**Option A – Repository environment secrets (recommended):**

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Environments**
2. Click on **"production"** (create it if it doesn't exist)
3. Under **"Environment secrets"**, click **"Add secret"**
4. Add each required secret (see table below)
5. Click **"Add secret"**

**Option B – Repository-level secrets:**

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add each required secret (see table below)

**Required secrets:**

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway project token (see [step 3.1](#31-generate-a-railway-project-token)) |
| `RAILWAY_SERVICE` | Exact name of the Railway service to deploy (e.g. `backend`) |

> **Note:** If either `RAILWAY_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_SERVICE` is missing or empty, the deployment step will be skipped with a warning message pointing to this guide. To find your service name, open your Railway project dashboard and note the name shown on the service card.

---

## 4. Database Migration

### Automatic Migrations

Database migrations run **automatically** on each deployment via the pre-deploy command in `railway.toml`:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This runs as a `preDeployCommand` — Railway executes the migration in a one-off container *before* promoting the new deployment live. If the migration fails, the deployment is rolled back and the previous version keeps serving traffic. This prevents broken schema from reaching the running app.

### Manual Migration (if needed)

If you need to run migrations manually:

1. Install the Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Link to your project:
   ```bash
   railway link
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Verify Migrations

To check the current migration status:

```bash
railway run alembic current
```

To see migration history:

```bash
railway run alembic history
```

---

## 5. Webhook Configuration

After deployment, you need to configure webhooks for external services.

### 5.1 Get Your Backend URL

1. Go to your Railway backend service
2. Click on the **"Settings"** tab
3. Find the **"Public Networking"** section
4. Copy your **Railway domain** (e.g., `https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app`)

### 5.2 Xendit Webhook Setup

1. Log in to your [Xendit Dashboard](https://dashboard.xendit.co)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Add a new webhook URL:
   ```
   https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/xendit/webhook
   ```
4. Select the events you want to receive:
   - `payment.succeeded`
   - `payment.failed`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.expired`
5. Save the webhook configuration

### 5.3 PayMongo Webhook Setup

1. Log in to [PayMongo Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymongo.com) → **Developers → Webhooks**
2. Create a webhook pointing to:
   ```
   https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/paymongo/webhook
   ```
3. Enable events: `source.chargeable`, `checkout_session.payment.paid`, `checkout_session.payment.failed`, `payment.paid`, `payment.failed`
4. Copy the **signing secret** → set as `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5.4 TransFi Webhook Setup

1. Log in to your [TransFi Checkout dashboard](https://checkout-dashboard.transfi.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integration** (or **Webhooks**)
3. Add a new webhook URL:
   ```
   https://<your-railway-domain>/api/v1/transfi/webhook
   ```
4. Copy the **webhook secret** and set it as `TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment variables.
5. Save the webhook configuration.

### 5.5 Telegram Webhook Setup

The Telegram webhook is automatically registered on startup when `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` is set. To set it up manually:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook"
  }'
```

Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token and update the URL with your Railway backend domain.

To verify the webhook is set:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Invalid or Missing RAILWAY_TOKEN

**Error**: `Invalid RAILWAY_TOKEN. Please check that it is valid and has access to the resource you're trying to use.`

**Solution**:
1. Generate a Railway project token: **Project Settings** → **Tokens** → **New Token** (select the **production** environment)
2. Add it as a GitHub secret named `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (see [GitHub Actions Secrets Setup](#3-github-actions-secrets-setup) for detailed instructions)
3. Verify the secret is added to the correct scope: the deploy workflow uses the `production` environment, so the secret should be an **environment secret** under the `production` environment, or a **repository secret**
4. If the token was previously set but is now expired or revoked, generate a new token and update the secret

#### Multiple Services Found / Missing RAILWAY_SERVICE

**Error**: `Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the --service flag.`

**Solution**:
1. Find your Railway service name by opening your Railway project dashboard and noting the name on the service card (e.g. `backend`)
2. Add it as a GitHub secret named `RAILWAY_SERVICE` (see [GitHub Actions Secrets Setup](#3-github-actions-secrets-setup))
3. If `RAILWAY_SERVICE` is missing or empty, the deploy step will be skipped with a warning rather than failing the workflow

#### Database Connection Errors

**Error**: `Failed to initialize database`

**Solution**:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in environment variables
2. Check PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
3. Ensure the database URL format is: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

#### Migration Failures

**Error**: `alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Can't locate revision identified by`

**Solution**:
1. Check if migrations are in sync:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic current
   ```
2. If needed, reset to head:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic stamp head
   railway run alembic upgrade head
   ```

#### CORS Errors

**Error**: `Access to fetch at 'https://backend...' from origin 'https://frontend...' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Solution**:
1. Add your frontend URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```

#### Port Binding Issues

**Error**: `Address already in use`

**Solution**:
Railway automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. Ensure your application uses `$PORT`:
```python
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

#### Telegram Webhook Not Receiving Updates

**Solution**:
1. Verify webhook is set correctly:
   ```bash
   curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
   ```
2. Check if the URL is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook
   ```
3. Delete and reset the webhook:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/deleteWebhook"
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" -d "url=https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook"
   ```

#### Admin Login Issues

**Error**: `Telegram admin authentication is not configured` (500 error on login)

**Solution**:
1. Set `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable
2. Set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` to your Telegram numeric user ID (find it via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
3. Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to a secure random string
